        Perform thorough crawling of the target website: http://testphp.vulnweb.com/.
        Your goal is to discover all accessible endpoints, including:
        1. Regular web pages
        2. API endpoints
        3. Forms and their parameters
        4. URL patterns that might reveal the site structure
        5. Hidden endpoints that might not be directly linked
        
        Use the Web Crawler tool to crawl through the site by passing the target URL as the 'url' parameter, like this:
        web_crawler(url="http://testphp.vulnweb.com/")
        
        Then use JavaScript Analyzer to find additional endpoints that might be referenced in JavaScript code, like this:
        javascript_analyzer(url="http://testphp.vulnweb.com/")
        
        IMPORTANT: Always pass the URL parameter when using these tools.
        
        Document all findings in a structured format.
