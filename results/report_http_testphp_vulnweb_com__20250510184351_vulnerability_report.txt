# TestPHP Vulnerable Web Application

## Executive Summary
This report details critical security vulnerabilities identified during a comprehensive assessment of http://testphp.vulnweb.com/. The assessment revealed multiple high-risk vulnerabilities including SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws, along with significant security header misconfigurations.

## Vulnerability Overview

### Critical Findings (3)
1. **SQL Injection** (CVSS 9.8) - Found in multiple endpoints:
   - /artists.php?artist=1
   - /product.php?pic=1  
   - /listproducts.php?cat=1

### High Findings (2)  
2. **Reflected XSS** (CVSS 7.1) - Found in:
   - /artists.php?artist=1
   - /product.php?pic=1

### Security Misconfigurations
3. **Missing Security Headers** - All critical security headers missing (Score: 0/14)
4. **Server Information Disclosure** - Exposes vulnerable nginx/1.19.0 and PHP/5.6.40

## Detailed Findings

### 1. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
**Endpoints Affected:**
- http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1
- http://testphp.vulnweb.com/product.php?pic=1
- http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1

**Technical Details:**
- Type: Error-based SQLi
- Parameters: artist, pic, cat
- Payload: `or true--`
- Impact: Full database compromise possible
- CVSS: 9.8 (Critical)

**Remediation:**
- Implement parameterized queries
- Add input validation for all parameters
- Configure proper error handling

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**Endpoints Affected:**
- http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1
- http://testphp.vulnweb.com/product.php?pic=1

**Technical Details:**
- Type: Reflected XSS
- Payload: `";a=prompt,a()//`
- Impact: Session hijacking possible
- CVSS: 7.1 (High)

**Remediation:**
- Implement output encoding
- Add Content Security Policy
- Validate all user inputs

### 3. Security Headers Analysis
**Missing Headers:**
1. Strict-Transport-Security
2. Content-Security-Policy  
3. X-Content-Type-Options
