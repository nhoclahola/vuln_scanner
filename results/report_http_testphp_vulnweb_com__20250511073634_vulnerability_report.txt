## Risk Assessment
| Vulnerability Type | Count | Average CVSS | Risk Level |
|--------------------|-------|-------------|------------|
| SQL Injection      | 2     | 9.8         | Critical   |
| XSS                | 2     | 7.1         | High       |
| Header Issues      | 8     | 5.0         | Medium     |

## Detailed Recommendations

### SQL Injection Remediation
1. Immediate Actions:
   - Implement parameterized queries for all database interactions
   - Apply strict input validation for all parameters
   - Configure proper error handling

2. Long-term Solutions:
   - Web Application Firewall implementation
   - Regular security testing schedule
   - Database account privilege reduction

### XSS Remediation
1. Immediate Actions:
   - Implement output encoding for all dynamic content
   - Add Content-Security-Policy header
   - Add X-XSS-Protection header

2. Long-term Solutions:
   - Security-focused development training
   - Input validation framework implementation
   - Regular XSS testing

### Header Security Improvements
1. Essential Headers to Implement:
   - Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
   - Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - X-Frame-Options: DENY
   - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
   - Remove X-Powered-By header
   - Obfuscate server version information

## Implementation Roadmap
1. Critical (0-7 days):
   - SQL injection fixes
   - Basic security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options)

2. High Priority (7-14 days):
   - XSS remediation
   - CSP implementation
   - Server information obfuscation

3. Medium Priority (14-30 days):
   - HSTS implementation
   - Referrer-Policy
   - Permissions-Policy

## Conclusion
The target website contains multiple critical vulnerabilities that require immediate attention. The most severe issues are the SQL injection vulnerabilities which could lead to complete database compromise. A comprehensive remediation plan should be implemented following the priority order outlined in this report. Regular security testing should be established to maintain security posture improvements.
